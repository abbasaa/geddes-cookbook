## Ingredients

* 2 pounds red potatoes (about 6 medium), cut into 3/4-inch pieces
* 1 large onion, coarsely chopped
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 1-1/4 teaspoons salt, divided
* 1 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed, divided
* 3/4 teaspoon pepper, divided
* 1/2 teaspoon paprika
* 6 bone-in chicken thighs (about 2-1/4 pounds), skin removed
* 6 cups fresh baby spinach (about 6 ounces)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425°. In a large bowl, combine potatoes, onion, oil, garlic, 3/4 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon rosemary and 1/2 teaspoon pepper; toss to coat. Transfer to a 15x10x1-in. baking pan coated with cooking spray.
